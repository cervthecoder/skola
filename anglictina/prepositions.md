Viola is confident about passing her chemistry graduation exam.
She relies on her ability to charm proffesor Šmahaj.
She's certain about that Šmahaj
won't be disapointed by her non-existent knowledge of thermodynamics.
Anyway, Viola is not concerned about studying anymore
because her plan to buy a new pretty dress is perfect.
Viola is not proud of herself for doing this
She's conviced of that she will pass
The thought of passing the exam like this makes her blushing.
